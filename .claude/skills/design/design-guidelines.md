# UI Design Guidelines

Use this when designing or building new UI with the top-level `design` skill, or when a workflow tells you to load design guidance before editing UI code.

## Load Contract

- Before writing UI code, scan the rule-file index below and load every rule file that could apply.
- Err on the side of loading too many rule files rather than too few.
- Treat rules as applicable even when they are indirect: heading group rules apply to hero sections; landing page rules apply to individual page sections; surface rules apply to dashboard cards and list items.
- Load reference modules only when the user's request needs that reference material.

## General Design Principles

- Every layout must adapt from mobile to desktop — use responsive breakpoint classes to adjust the design at different screen sizes; see [Responsive Design](./guidelines/responsive-design.md) for detailed rules

## Rule Files

Follow these rules when designing or building UI. Each rule file covers a specific topic:

- [Avatars](./guidelines/avatars.md) — profile photos, user thumbnails, and people images used in testimonials, team sections, comments, and anywhere a person's face appears

- [Buttons](./guidelines/buttons.md) — primary and secondary buttons, CTAs, icon buttons, destructive/danger actions, and touch targets
- [Colors](./guidelines/colors.md) — brand colors, accent colors, color palette selection, and default color choices
- [Copywriting](./guidelines/copywriting.md) — punctuation, periods, headings, taglines, subtitles, descriptions, and list items
- [Custom Fonts](./guidelines/custom-fonts.md) — loading custom fonts via `<link>` tags or `@import url()`, registering fonts in `@theme` with `--font-*`, font-feature-settings, and font-variation-settings

- [Feature Lists](./guidelines/feature-lists.md) — feature grids, feature sections, benefit lists, and any section that lists multiple features with titles and descriptions
- [Flexbox Layout](./guidelines/flexbox-layout.md) — flex containers, flex children, `min-w-0` shrinking behavior, `shrink-0` on icons/images/SVGs, fluid vs fixed layouts, sidebar + content patterns, and any layout using `flex-1` or flexible sizing
- [Footers](./guidelines/footers.md) — page footers, footer logos, footer links, social media icons, and site-wide bottom navigation
- [Form Controls](./guidelines/form-controls.md) — inputs, selects, checkboxes, radio buttons, login forms, sign-up forms, checkout forms, search bars, newsletter sign-up fields, and input + button combos
- [General](./guidelines/general.md) — general markup rules (class placement on block vs inline elements, redundant display classes, `role="list"`) and Tailwind CSS authoring rules (utility preferences, spacing conventions, arbitrary value syntax, variant patterns, deprecated utilities) that apply across all components
- [Headers](./guidelines/headers.md) — site headers, navigation bars, navbars, top bars, logos, mobile menus, and hamburger menus
- [Heading Groups](./guidelines/heading-groups.md) — the headline, subheadline, and optional eyebrow at the top of marketing and landing page sections (hero, features, team, pricing, CTA, etc.); does not apply to blog posts, articles, or editorial content
- [Icons](./guidelines/icons.md) — SVG icons, icon sizing, icon alignment with text, Heroicons, filled vs stroked icons, and inline list icons like checkmarks

- [Login Pages](./guidelines/login-pages.md) — login, sign-in, sign-up, and authentication page backgrounds and layout rules

- [Prose Content](./guidelines/prose-content.md) — styling raw HTML from markdown, CMS, or database content where Tailwind classes can't be applied to individual elements; replaces the `@tailwindcss/typography` plugin with a custom `.prose` class
- [Pricing Cards](./guidelines/pricing-cards.md) — pricing tiers, pricing tables, plan cards, emphasized/popular plan styling, and button alignment across pricing columns
- [Responsive Design](./guidelines/responsive-design.md) — responsive breakpoints, container queries, `@container` placement, and mobile-to-desktop layout adaptation

- [Section Layout](./guidelines/section-layout.md) — left-aligned vs centered section layouts, content width constraints, and aligning containers across stacked page sections
- [Shadows](./guidelines/shadows.md) — box shadows on cards, modals, popovers, dropdowns, and elevated elements, including border pairing rules
- [Surfaces](./guidelines/surfaces.md) — cards, wells, borders, dividers, and white space as surface treatments; when to use cards vs subtle dividers vs recessed backgrounds vs no separation at all; applies to stat grids, dashboard metrics, list items, sidebars, and any content grouping decision

- [Typography](./guidelines/typography.md) — font weights, line heights, text sizes, heading styles, max-width constraints, text-pretty/text-balance, tracking, and eyebrow text

## Reference Modules

Load these only when the request needs the reference:

- [Assets API](./guidelines/assets-api.md) — placeholder asset URLs, query parameters, and examples for marks, avatars, logos, screenshots, and wallpapers
- [Font Recommendations](./guidelines/font-recommendations.md) — optional font suggestions for when the user asks for help choosing a font or wants to try different fonts across design variations; includes sourcing notes, feature settings, and tips for each font

## Design Conflicts

When a rule says **⚠️ ask-user**, the user's input conflicts with a design guideline. Do not silently override the user or silently follow their request. Instead:

1. Use the `AskUserQuestion` tool to flag the conflict
2. Explain what the guideline recommends and why the input doesn't fit
3. Offer a concrete alternative (e.g. a rewritten version of their copy, a different layout)
4. Wait for the user to choose before proceeding

Never skip this — even if it feels minor. The user should always be aware when their input bumps up against a design rule.
