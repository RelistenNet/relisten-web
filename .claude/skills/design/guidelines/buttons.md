# Buttons

Covers: primary buttons, secondary buttons, CTAs, icon buttons, destructive actions, form actions, and touch targets.

## Design Rules

- When adding shadows to buttons, follow the shadow rules in `shadows.md` — never pair `shadow-*` with solid gray borders; use `ring-1 ring-black/5` or `ring-1 ring-black/10` instead
- Primary buttons with a ring — never use reduced opacity on the ring; use a solid color that matches the button background (e.g. `ring-indigo-600` on an `bg-indigo-600` button, not `ring-black/10`)
- Dangerous actions like "Delete" use a secondary/muted button style by default — only use a primary button style when the dangerous action is the primary action on the page or dialog (e.g. a confirm-delete dialog)
- Only one primary button per page — scan the entire page and ensure only one button uses a filled/solid primary style; every other button must use a secondary style — soft/muted (solid with opacity), outline, or ghost (text-only); treat dialogs/modals as their own page
- Never make a secondary button higher contrast than the primary button — the primary button must always be the most visually prominent
- Any button that is not the page's primary submit/save action is an inline form action — change avatar, change photo, upload file, generate password, verify email, add item, resend code, etc.; always use the smaller of the two button sizes and a secondary style; these must never be the same height as the form's primary/submit button

### Sizing

- Use less horizontal padding — `px-3 py-2` not `px-4 py-2`, `px-4 py-3` not `px-5 py-3`
- Application UIs (dashboards, settings, admin) — `text-sm` with compact padding, never `text-base`; total rendered button height (including outer wrapper/ring) must stay within 28–38px; account for the `p-px` border wrapper when calculating — the wrapper adds 2px total
- Maximum 2 button sizes per application UI — pick two distinct heights and use only those; the difference between them must be at least 6px
- Buttons with a leading or trailing icon — never use symmetric `px-*`; use `pl-*`/`pr-*` and set the icon side's padding equal to the vertical padding: `py-2 pr-3 pl-2` (left icon), `py-2 pr-2 pl-3` (right icon), `py-1.5 pr-2.5 pl-1.5` (left icon, compact)

### Focus Styles

- Solid buttons need a custom focus ring — use `focus-visible:outline-*` with `focus-visible:outline-offset-2`; default to `focus-visible:outline-blue-500` if the project has no established focus color

## Coding Rules

- Small/icon buttons must meet the 48×48px minimum touch target — make the button `relative` and add `<span class="absolute top-1/2 left-1/2 size-[max(100%,3rem)] -translate-1/2 pointer-fine:hidden" aria-hidden="true" />` as a direct child
