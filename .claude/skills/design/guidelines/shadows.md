# Shadows

Covers: shadows on cards, modals, popovers, dropdowns, buttons, elevated surfaces, and shadow/border pairings.

- Never pair shadows with solid gray borders — use `ring-1 ring-black/5` or `ring-1 ring-black/10` (or `950` of your neutral)
- Never make elevated elements (cards, modals, popovers with `shadow-*`) darker than their canvas — use `white` or the lightest neutral, not `gray-100`/`gray-50`; darker fills are fine for inset panels/wells without outer shadows
