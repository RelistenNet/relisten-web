# Navigation

Covers: sidebar nav, header nav, mobile menus, tabs, tab bars, vertical menus, active states, and current-page indicators.

- Every app must have a mobile navigation menu on small screens, regardless of whether the desktop nav is in a header or sidebar — use a dialog or disclosure panel with a hamburger toggle; hide the desktop nav with `hidden lg:flex` (header) or `hidden lg:block` (sidebar) and show the mobile menu below `lg:`
- Never use a high-contrast or primary-color background for active nav items — use darker text color, a soft/muted background, or both
- Never change `font-weight` between nav item states (default, hover, active) — use color and background changes only
- Horizontal menus (tabs, tab bars, pill navs) must never overflow the parent container — use horizontal scrolling when items don't fit
- Never use icons in top header horizontal navigation links — use text-only links
- When centering nav links on the page (not just between side items), use a three-section flex layout: `<div class="flex flex-1 items-center">` for the left section (logo), the nav links in their natural width (no `flex-1`), and `<div class="flex flex-1 items-center justify-end">` for the right section (actions). The matching `flex-1` gutters force the centered group to the true page center. Apply the same pattern when centering a logo: keep the logo in its natural width and use `flex-1` on the side sections to center it on the page rather than between the surrounding items.
